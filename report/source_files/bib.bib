	abstract={Parameterization and parameter tuning are central aspects of climate modeling, and there is widespread consensus that these procedures involve certain subjective elements. Even if the use of these subjective elements is not necessarily epistemically problematic, there is an intuitive appeal for replacing them with more objective (automated) methods, such as machine learning. Relying on several case studies, we argue that, while machine learning techniques may help to improve climate model parameterization in several ways, they still require expert judgment that involves subjective elements not so different from the ones arising in standard parameterization and tuning. The use of machine learning in parameterizations is an art as well as a science and requires careful supervision.},

	abstract = {In climate science, climate models are one of the main tools for understanding phenomena. Here, we develop a framework to assess the fitness of a climate model for providing understanding. The framework is based on three dimensions: representational accuracy, representational depth, and graspability. We show that this framework does justice to the intuition that classical process-based climate models give understanding of phenomena. While simple climate models are characterized by a larger graspability, state-of-the-art models have a higher representational accuracy and representational depth. We then compare the fitness-for-providing understanding of process-based to data-driven models that are built with machine learning. We show that at first glance, data-driven models seem either unnecessary or inadequate for understanding. However, a case study from atmospheric research demonstrates that this is a false dilemma. Data-driven models can be useful tools for understanding, specifically for phenomena for which scientists can argue from the coherence of the models with background knowledge to their representational accuracy and for which the model complexity can be reduced such that they are graspable to a satisfactory extent.}

The next step will be a hybrid modelling approach, coupling physical process models with the versatility of data-driven machine learning.},

	abstract = {Global medium-range weather forecasting is critical to decision-making across many social and economic domains. Traditional numerical weather prediction uses increased compute resources to improve forecast accuracy but does not directly use historical weather data to improve the underlying model. Here, we introduce GraphCast, a machine learning–based method trained directly from reanalysis data. It predicts hundreds of weather variables for the next 10 days at 0.25° resolution globally in under 1 minute. GraphCast significantly outperforms the most accurate operational deterministic systems on 90\% of 1380 verification targets, and its forecasts support better severe event prediction, including tropical cyclone tracking, atmospheric rivers, and extreme temperatures. GraphCast is a key advance in accurate and efficient weather forecasting and helps realize the promise of machine learning for modeling complex dynamical systems. The numerical models used to predict weather are large, complex, and computationally demanding and do not learn from past weather patterns. Lam et al. introduced a machine learning–based method that has been trained directly from reanalysis data of past atmospheric conditions. In this way, the authors were able to quickly predict hundreds of weather variables globally up to 10 days in advance and at high resolution. Their predictions were more accurate than those of traditional weather models in 90\% of tested cases and displayed better severe event prediction for tropical cyclones, atmospheric rivers, and extreme temperatures. —H.

These models can provide decision-relevant predictions, but confident decision-making requires that the involved uncertainties are understood. We argue that existing frameworks for characterizing uncertainties are not appropriate for data-driven models because of their focus on distinct locations of uncertainty. We propose a framework for uncertainty assessment that uses argument analysis to assess the justification of the assumption that the model is fit for the predictive purpose at hand. Its flexibility makes the framework applicable to data-driven models. The framework is illustrated using a case study from environmental science. We show that data-driven models can be subject to substantial second-order uncertainty, i.e., uncertainty in the assessment of the predictive uncertainty, because they are often applied to ill-understood problems. We close by discussing the implications of the predictive uncertainties of data-driven models for decision-making.}

In this work, we present our developments in the context of solving two main classes of problems: data-driven solution and data-driven discovery of partial differential equations. Depending on the nature and arrangement of the available data, we devise two distinct types of algorithms, namely continuous time and discrete time models. The first type of models forms a new family of data-efficient spatio-temporal function approximators, while the latter type allows the use of arbitrarily accurate implicit Runge–Kutta time stepping schemes with unlimited number of stages. The effectiveness of the proposed framework is demonstrated through a collection of classical problems in fluids, quantum mechanics, reaction–diffusion systems, and the propagation of nonlinear shallow-water waves.}

	abstract = {Abstract The Southern Ocean Carbon and Climate Observations and Modeling (SOCCOM) program has begun deploying a large array of biogeochemical sensors on profiling floats in the Southern Ocean. As of February 2016, 86 floats have been deployed. Here the focus is on 56 floats with quality-controlled and adjusted data that have been in the water at least 6 months. The floats carry oxygen, nitrate, pH, chlorophyll fluorescence, and optical backscatter sensors. The raw data generated by these sensors can suffer from inaccurate initial calibrations and from sensor drift over time. Procedures to correct the data are defined. The initial accuracy of the adjusted concentrations is assessed by comparing the corrected data to laboratory measurements made on samples collected by a hydrographic cast with a rosette sampler at the float deployment station. The long-term accuracy of the corrected data is compared to the GLODAPv2 data set whenever a float made a profile within 20 km of a GLODAPv2 station. Based on these assessments, the fleet average oxygen data are accurate to 1 ± 1\%, nitrate to within 0.5 ± 0.5 µmol kg−1, and pH to 0.005 ± 0.007, where the error limit is 1 standard deviation of the fleet data. The bio-optical measurements of chlorophyll fluorescence and optical backscatter are used to estimate chlorophyll a and particulate organic carbon concentration. The particulate organic carbon concentrations inferred from optical backscatter appear accurate to with 35 mg C m−3 or 20\%, whichever is larger. Factors affecting the accuracy of the estimated chlorophyll a concentrations are evaluated.},

	abstract={Ocean acidification is likely to impact marine ecosystems and human societies adversely and is a carbon cycle issue of great concern. Projecting the degree of ocean acidification and the carbon-climate feedback will require understanding the current status, variability, and trends of ocean inorganic carbon system variables and the ocean carbon sink. With this goal in mind, we reconstructed total alkalinity (TA), dissolved inorganic carbon (DIC), CO2 partial pressure (pCO2sea), sea--air CO2 flux, pH, and aragonite saturation state ($\Omega$arg) for the global ocean based on measurements of pCO2sea and TA. We used a multiple linear regression approach to derive relationships to explain TA and DIC and obtained monthly 1{\textdegree}{\thinspace}{\texttimes}{\thinspace}1{\textdegree} gridded values of TA and DIC for the period 1993--2018. These data were converted to pCO2sea, pH, and $\Omega$arg, and monthly sea-air CO2 fluxes were obtained in combination with atmospheric CO2. Mean annual sea--air CO2 flux and its rate of change were estimated to be{\thinspace}−{\thinspace}2.0{\thinspace}{\textpm}{\thinspace}0.5 PgC year−1 and{\thinspace}−{\thinspace}0.3 (PgC year−1) decade−1, respectively. Our analysis revealed that oceanic CO2 uptake decreased during the 1990s and has been increasing since 2000. Our estimate of the globally averaged rate of pH change,{\thinspace}−{\thinspace}0.0181{\thinspace}{\textpm}{\thinspace}0.0001 decade−1, was consistent with that expected from the trend of atmospheric CO2 growth. However, rates of decline of pH were relatively slow in the Southern Ocean (−{\thinspace}0.0165{\thinspace}{\textpm}{\thinspace}0.0001{\textperiodcentered}decade−1) and in the western equatorial Pacific (−{\thinspace}0.0148{\thinspace}{\textpm}{\thinspace}0.0002{\textperiodcentered}decade−1).

To create these maps, we used the neural network-based data interpolation method of Landschützer et al. (2014) but extended the work in time from 1998 to 2011 to the period from 1982 through 2011. Our results suggest strong decadal variations in the global ocean carbon sink around a long-term increase that corresponds roughly to that expected from the rise in atmospheric CO2. The sink is estimated to have weakened during the 1990s toward a minimum uptake of only −0.8 ± 0.5 Pg C yr−1 in 2000 and thereafter to have strengthened considerably to rates of more than −2.0 ± 0.5 Pg C yr−1. These decadal variations originate mostly from the extratropical oceans, while the tropical regions contribute primarily to interannual variations. Changes in sea surface temperature affecting the solubility of CO2 explain part of these variations, particularly at subtropical latitudes. But most of the higher-latitude changes are attributed to modifications in the surface concentration of dissolved inorganic carbon and alkalinity, induced by decadal variations in atmospheric forcing, with patterns that are reminiscent of those of the Northern and Southern Annular Modes. These decadal variations lead to a substantially smaller cumulative anthropogenic CO2 uptake of the ocean over the 1982 through 2011 period (reduction of 7.5 ± 5.5 Pg C) relative to that derived by the Global Carbon Budget.},

	ABSTRACT={The global ocean is a major sink of anthropogenic carbon dioxide (CO<sub>2</sub>) emitted into the atmosphere. Machine learning has been actively used in the past decades to estimate the oceanic sink, but it is still a challenge to obtain an accurate estimate due to scarcely available CO<sub>2</sub> measurements. One of the methods to deal with data scarcity was normalizing multiple years’ CO<sub>2</sub> values to a reference year to increase the spatial coverage. The practice assumed a constant CO<sub>2</sub> trend for the normalization. Here, we used three machine learning models to extract variable ocean CO<sub>2</sub> trends on a decadal scale and proposed a method to use the extracted ocean CO<sub>2</sub> trends to correct the decadal atmospheric CO<sub>2</sub> trends for data normalization. The method minimizes assumptions of using the extracted ocean CO<sub>2</sub> trends directly. Comparisons of our CO<sub>2</sub> flux estimate with machine learning products included in Global Carbon Budget 2021 indicates that using the variable trends improved the bias resulted from using a constant trend and that the trends are a critical factor for machine learning methods. Our dataset includes monthly distributions of surface ocean CO<sub>2</sub> concentration and air-sea flux in 1980-2020 with a spatial resolution of 1×1 degree.}

	abstract = {Abstract The ocean plays a critical role in modulating climate change by sequestering CO2 from the atmosphere. Quantifying the CO2 flux across the air-sea interface requires time-dependent maps of surface ocean partial pressure of CO2 (pCO2), which can be estimated using global ocean biogeochemical models (GOBMs) and observational-based data products. GOBMs are internally consistent, mechanistic representations of the ocean circulation and carbon cycle, and have long been the standard for making spatio-temporally resolved estimates of air-sea CO2 fluxes. However, there are concerns about the fidelity of GOBM flux estimates. Observation-based products have the strength of being data-based, but the underlying data are sparse and require significant extrapolation to create global full-coverage flux estimates. The Lamont Doherty Earth Observatory-Hybrid Physics Data (LDEO-HPD) pCO2 product is a new approach to estimating the temporal evolution of surface ocean pCO2 and air-sea CO2 exchange. LDEO-HPD uses machine learning to merge high-quality observations with state-of-the-art GOBMs. We train an eXtreme Gradient Boosting (XGB) algorithm to learn a non-linear relationship between model-data mismatch and observed predictors. GOBM fields are then corrected with the predicted model-data misfit to estimate real-world pCO2 for 1982–2018. The resulting reconstruction by LDEO-HPD is in better agreement with independent pCO2 observations than other currently available observation-based products. Within uncertainties, LDEO-HPD global ocean uptake of CO2 agrees with other products and the Global Carbon Budget 2020.},
